
HYPOTHESIS:
Ozone in the atmosphere has depleted since 2005.




DATA:





NOTES:
juxtaposition works well for rastors as they would not work if layered on top of one antoher
- it is also easy to compare areas of interest between two maps

The visuals show that the ozone layer hasn't nessesarily depleted, but instead seems to have 
been distributed across the globe more evenly. The dense spot south of Australia has thinned 
while the rest of teh globe has thickened. The "Ozone hole" over Antartica has also shurnk in size.



COLOR CHOICE:
 
I noticed when using the opacity slider that the opacity really affects your ability to compare colors on the map to the scale.
By default the opacity was set to .5 which made it quite difficult to see the continent shiluetes behind the colors. To solve this 
I reduced the default opacity to .45 and kept the option to change the opacity so you may set it to your desire. Turning the opacity 
up to 1.0 will result in colors being represented 1:1 to the scale. Vega offers no way to set opacity of colors on the scale itself.
