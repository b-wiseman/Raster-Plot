    Ozone in the atmosphere has depleted since 2005.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    My hypothesis was that Ozone in our atmosphere has depleted since 2005. After some light reasearch I saw taht this 
    has been a concern. After visualizing my data it appeared that ozone has distributed more evenly across the atmosphere 
    rather than depleted. The "Ozone hole" over Antarctica that has drawn concern seems to have become smaller over the 
    years. Also, the thick area south of Australia has thinned while the thin patch spanning the equator has filled in.

  <h2>Color Choice</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing a color for this visual was an interesting process. I ended up choosing green which was something I tried to 
      avoid as per Muth's color artcle. I noticed that in order for the continents to be visible I would need to reduce the opacity. 
      After doing this I saw that it affected the ability to compare the mapped colors with the colors on the scale. With 
      there being no way to adjust the opacity of the scale's colors in Vega I started trying to balance the opacity with the scale 
      as well as trying different colors to see what worked best. I felt that the green worked well in this regard and settled on it 
      at a .45 default opacity. I kept the slider available so it can be changed to the user's desire. Turning opacity up to 1.0 will 
      result in the most accurate colors but will remove the ability to see the continents. As far as accessibility and the critique of 
      the color green in visuals, I figured there is only one color being shaded for the visual and that it would be fine to use 
      green in this instance. I thought about using different colors for each year but figured this added more ambiguity than it was worth.
